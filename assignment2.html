	<h2 style="color:083D77;">Part 1: Analyze The Tower website using a useability framework</h2>
	<h3 style="color:mediumseagreen;">Step 1: Explore and consider the information that goes into (input) or comes out (output) of the system.</h3>
	<p>
	<table style="width:80%">
  <tr style:"height:200px">
    <td style="width:40%">Inputs</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Clicked on The Tower 1961-1980</td>
    <td>Linked to a page with a search bar that searched specifically The Tower 1961-1980, Pictorial links to specific issues within the 1961-1980 timeframe, includes a way to refine search results, Each pictorial link has an option to download, save or cite the particular issue. </td>

    <td>When I clicked into the search bar, offered suggestions of “Just search for: pep rally, Author or creator: pep rally, Title: pep rally, Publication name: pep rally, Search for images: pep rally”. I chose Just search for: pep rally. I received 14 results ranging in dates from 2003 to 2013. It sorted by relevance. </td>

	<h3 style="color:mediumseagreen;">Step 2: Critique The Tower website using the perspective supporting an undergraduate teacher who would like to incorporate original source materials into his/her lesson plans and student learning activities.</h3>
	<p>
	<h4 style="color:teal">Undergraduate teacher's lesson plan: Changing ideals and values in the smoking of tobacco. </h4>

<ul>
  <li>Concepts:</li>
	<ul>
  	<li>Vaping as an alternative to smoking tobacco</li>
  	<li>Recent push for "smoke-free" areas</li>
	</ul>
 </ul>
<ul>
  <li>Aims:</li>
	<ul>
  	<li>Examine whether values and ideals toward smoking tobacco are changing on Catholic University Campus. </li>  	
	</ul>
 </ul>
<ul>
	<li>Learning Outcomes:</li>
		<ul>
		<li>Provide an example of “vaping” from The Tower archive</li>
		<li>Provide an example of recent “smoke-free” push on campus from The Tower archive.</li>
		<li>Explain what could be pushing these changes to occur.</li>
		<li>Evaluate whether the “smoke-free” campus is a viable option for the Catholic University Campus.</li>

	<li>Assessment:</li>

	<h3 style="color:mediumseagreen;">Step 3: Summarize Part 1 with the top two strengths and top two weaknesses of the system.</h3>
	<p>

	</p>	
	<h2 style="color:083D77;">Part 2: Conduct a "mini-usability test."</h2>	

	<p>
	One of the cons of the system is that a patron has to be willing to wait for items to be delivered as the shuttle between libraries only runs one day a week. Another con is that a patron doesn’t necessarily have access to the online databases at Longwood or Hampden-Sydney which means the patron may have to request an ILL through their public library for an item. They do have access to going to the physical library and doing their searches in person but that can be an impediment if they do not drive or are farther out in one of the more rural areas surrounding the counties covered by the SALSA consortium. 
	</p>
	<p>
A pro to SALSA is that it does open up the availability of several thousand items that the public libraries may not have access to otherwise. It also opens up the doors of the academic libraries for members of the public libraries to be able to study and access their information in person. 
	</p>

	<h3 style="color:mediumseagreen;">Step 4: Find a friend or colleague willing to spend twenty minutes using The Tower website. </h3>
	
	<p>
	Task 1 and Task 2 deliverables submitted separately. 
	</p>
	<h3 style="color:mediumseagreen;">Step 5: Brief comparison of the results of Part 1 and 2. </h3>
	<p>
	Task 1 and Task 2 deliverables submitted separately.
