It also offers a list of the most recent articles along the bottom of the page. The main page offers a scrolling bar of the most recent stories for ease of access. At the bottom of each page there is a “Return to top” link that returns the user to the top of the page which given the length of the archives listed on each page make it much easier to return to the top of the page.</td>

If they were separated a little more into categories it may give a better flow.

	<h3 style="color:mediumseagreen;">Step 3: Summarize Part 1 with the top two strengths and top two weaknesses of the system.</h3>

<h5 style="color:teal;"><b>Weakness 1: </b></h5>
	<p>
Length of page – Having the archives listed twice on the page (once on the right and then once on the left) makes the webpage twice as long as it needs to be which can keep a person from going all the way to the bottom to find more information as needed. 
	</p>	
	<img src="archives_left_of_screen.png" width="375" height="300"><img src="archives_right_of_screen.png" width="375" height="300">
<h5 style="color:teal;"><b>Weakness 2: </b></h5>
	<p>
No Advanced search option – having an advanced search option would help a user to focus their search more to weed out unnecessary items that pop up in the search. It would also offer the ability to find a particular article faster if it is not within the first screen of the results field. 
	</p>
<img src="no_advance_search.png" width="375" height="300">

<h5 style="color:teal;"><b>Strength 1: </b></h5>
	<p>
The Tower website offers an interactive pop-down menu that follows the user down the page allowing the user to switch between sections of the site quickly and easily. 
	</p>
<img src="interactive_pop-down_menu.png" width="375" height="300">

<h5 style="color:teal;"><b>Strength 2: </b></h5>
	<p>
The Tower is up-to-date and is regularly updated allowing students access to news and information relevant quickly and easily. 
	</p>
	<img src="relevant_and_up-to-date_articles.png" width="375" height="300">
	
<h2 style="color:083D77;">Part 2: Conduct a "mini-usability test."</h2>	
	

	<h3 style="color:mediumseagreen;">Step 4: Find a friend or colleague willing to spend twenty minutes using The Tower website. </h3>
	
	<p>
	Task 1 and Task 2 deliverables submitted separately within Brightspace.  
	</p>
	<h3 style="color:mediumseagreen;">Step 5: Brief comparison of the results of Part 1 and 2. </h3>
	<p>
	During the mini-usability test, it was clear (through non-verbal cues) the participant was frustrated with the search feature of the site. When questioned about the frustration, the participant responded that the lack of an advanced search feature limited the results he felt he could get on The Tower website. He felt the articles he did find were limited in their usefulness for a student looking for information on World War II. He stated that while he could find several articles on World War II he found significantly fewer articles on the Vietnam War and didn’t feel that he found any that gave campus perspectives of either conflict. The participant did say that he found the site appealing with the images that were available but that it could be improved by adding a drop-down menu or advanced search feature to be able to limit the search. 
	</p>
	<p>
In conducting my own research on The Tower site, I found I had similar thoughts to the participant in that an advanced search would offer more fulfilling results. The search keyword I used was “smoking” and it resulted in two pages of results, of which at least two articles were about European laws about smoking. When I tried to limit my search to “smoking on campus” the search found no results so I tried “smoking” and “campus” which found several results about the banning of smoking on the campus of Catholic University, including an editorial disagreeing with the decision. 
	</p>
	<p>
Overall, The Tower website is a fairly simple to use website that will be able to offer someone information quickly and easily but it could benefit from adding an advanced search option to be able to narrow down search results. One change that could visually be made is by removing one of the archives that are listed on the page, they make the page scroll too long and many people wouldn’t go to the bottom and may miss information that is useful.
